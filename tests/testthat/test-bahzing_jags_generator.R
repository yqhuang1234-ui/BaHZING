# NOTE: the fixtures below are not a byte-for-byte copy of BaHZING's original
# hand-written model text - one deliberate change was made on top of it. The
# original always named the narrowest (species-role) level's precision nodes
# bare `tau`/`sigma` (every other level prefixes them, e.g. `genus.tau`) and
# its borrowed-mean node `mu.species` (named after itself, instead of
# `mu.genus`, the parent-naming convention every other level follows). Both
# are legacy inconsistencies with no functional weight - `tau`/`sigma`/`mu.*`
# are never monitored/extracted JAGS nodes - so they were made consistent
# with every other level's naming convention rather than preserved. The
# fixtures reflect that change; everything else here still matches the
# original model exactly.

# Normalizes JAGS text for structural comparison: strips "#..."-to-end-of-line
# comments (JAGS ignores these entirely - they carry no statistical meaning,
# and the original hand-written model text is inconsistent in its comment
# wording/capitalization from level to level, e.g. "#zero inflation" vs
# "#Zero inflation" vs "#zero infl" vs "#zero component") and strips all
# whitespace entirely, not just collapsing it - the original text is also
# inconsistent about e.g. spaces after commas (genus's block omits the space
# genus/family/order/class all otherwise use) - so two model strings that
# define the same JAGS model compare equal regardless of any cosmetic
# formatting differences.
